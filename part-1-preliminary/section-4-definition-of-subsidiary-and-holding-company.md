# Section 4. Definition of "subsidiary and holding company"

1. Subject to _subsection (3), a corporation shall be deemed to be a subsidiary of another corporation, but only if— 

  * the other corporation—

    * controls the composition of the board of directors of the corporation;  
    * controls more than half of the voting power of the corporation; or  
    * holds more than half of the issued share capital of the corporation, excluding any part of the share capital which consists of preference shares; or

  * the corporation is a subsidiary of any corporation which is that other corporation’s subsidiary.

**\(2\)** For the purposes of _subparagraph \(1\)\(a\)\(i\)_, the composition of a corporation’s board of directors shall be deemed to be controlled by another corporation if that other corporation can appoint or remove all or a majority of the directors and for the purposes of this provision, the holding company shall be deemed to have the power to make such an appointment if—

     \(a\)  a person cannot be appointed as a director without the exercise of such a power in his favour by   
     that other corporation; or

     \(b\)  a person’s appointment as a director follows necessarily from his being a director or other officer   
     of that other corporation.

**\(3\)** In determining whether one corporation is a subsidiary of another corporation—

     \(a\)  any shares held or power exercisable by that other corporation in a fiduciary capacity shall be   
     treated as not held or exercisable by it;

     \(b\)  subject to _paragraphs \(c\)_ and _\(d\)_, any shares held or power exercisable—  
            
          \(i\)  by any person as a nominee for that other corporation, except where that other corporation is   
          concerned only in a fiduciary capacity; or

          \(ii\)  by, or by a nominee for, a subsidiary of that other corporation, not being a subsidiary which is   
          concerned only in a fiduciary capacity, shall be treated as held or exercisable by that other   
          corporation;

     \(c\)  any shares held or power exercisable by any person by virtue of the provisions of any debentures of  
     the corporation or of a trust deed for securing any issue of such debentures shall be disregarded; and

     \(d\) any shares held or power exercisable by, or by a nominee for, that other corporation or its subsidiary,   
     not being held or exercisable as mentioned in _paragraph \(c\)_, shall be treated as not held or exercisable  
     by that other corporation if the ordinary business of that other corporation or its subsidiary, as the case  
     may be, includes the lending of money and the shares are held or power is exercisable as aforesaid by  
     way of security only for the purposes of a transaction entered into in the ordinary course of that  
     business.

**\(4\)** A reference in this Act to the holding company of a company or other corporation shall be read as a reference to a corporation of which that company or corporation is a subsidiary.
