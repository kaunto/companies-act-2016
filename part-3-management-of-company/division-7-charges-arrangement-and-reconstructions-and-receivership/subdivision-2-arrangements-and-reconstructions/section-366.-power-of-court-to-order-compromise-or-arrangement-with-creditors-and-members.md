     \(a\) the company;

     \(b\) any creditor or member of the company;

     \(c\) the liquidator, if the company is being wound up; or

     \(d\) the judicial manager, if the company is under judicial management.

\(2\) A meeting held pursuant to an order of the Court made under _subsection \(1\)_ may be adjourned if the resolution for adjournment is approved by seventy-five per centum of the total value of creditors or class of creditors or the members or class of members present and voting either in person or by proxy at the meeting.

     \(a\) all the creditors or class of creditors;

     \(b\) the members or class of members;

     \(c\) the company; or

     \(d\) the liquidator and contributories, if the company is being wound up,

if the compromise or arrangement is agreed by a majority of seventy-five per centum of the total value of the creditors or class of creditors or members or class of members present and voting either in person or by proxy at the meeting or the adjourned meeting and has been approved by order of the Court.

\(4\) The Court may grant its approval to a compromise or arrangement subject to such alterations or conditions as the Court thinks just.

\(5\) An order under _subsection \(3\)_ shall have no effect until an office copy of the order is lodged with the Registrar, and upon being so lodged, the order shall take effect on and from the date of lodgement or such earlier date as the Court may determine and as may be specified in the order.

\(6\) Subject to _subsection \(7\)_, a copy of every order made under _subsection \(3\)_ shall be annexed to every copy of the constitution of the company issued after the order has been made, or in the case of a company not having a constitution, to every copy of the instrument issued constituting or defining the constitution of the company.

\(7\) The Court may, by order, exempt a company from complying with the requirements of _subsection \(6\)_ or determine the period during which the company shall comply with the requirements.

\(8\) If any such compromise or arrangement, whether or not for the purposes of or in connection with a scheme for the reconstruction of any company or the amalgamation of any two or more companies, has been proposed, the directors of the company shall—

     \(a\) if a meeting of the members of the company by resolution directs, instruct such accountants or  
     advocates or both as are named in the resolution to report on the proposals and forward their report to  
     the directors as soon as practicable; and

     \(b\) make the report available at the registered office of the company for inspection by the shareholders  
     and creditors of the company at least seven days before the date of any meeting ordered by the Court  
     to be summoned in accordance with _subsection \(1\)_.

\(9\) The company and every officer who contravene _subsection \(6\)_ or _\(8\)_ commit an offence.
