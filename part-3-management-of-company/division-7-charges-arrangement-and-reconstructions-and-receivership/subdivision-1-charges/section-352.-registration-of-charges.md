# Section 352. Registration of charges

\(1\) A company that creates a charge over its property or any of its undertakings to which this section applies shall lodge within thirty days from the creation of the charge, together with the prescribed fee with the Registrar for registration, a statement of particulars of the charge in the form and manner as may be determined by the Registrar.

\(2\) If a company contravenes with _subsection \(1\)_, the charge shall be void against the liquidator and any creditor of the company, so far as any security on the company’s property or undertaking is conferred.

\(3\) Nothing in _subsection \(2\)_ shall prejudice any contract or obligation for the repayment of the money secured by a charge and when a charge becomes void under this section, the money secured shall immediately become payable.

\(4\) Any charge created, before the lapse of thirty days before a prior charge is registered with respect of the same debts, or a part of the debts, the charge shall not be valid or operative unless the Court is satisfied that the charge was created for the purpose of correcting some material error in the prior charge or under other proper circumstances and not for the purposes of avoiding or evading the provisions of this Subdivision.

\(5\) Failure to register a charge created over a company’s property or undertaking other than those relating to land, shall not affect the validity or limit the effect of the charge created under _subsection \(1\)_.

\(6\) _Subsection \(1\)_ shall not apply—

     \(a\) to a charge created to secure payment or performance of a financial obligation arising from any  
     instruments or transactions effected in the money market in such manner and to such extent as may  
     be specified by the Central Bank of Malaysia under the Financial Services Act 2013 or the Islamic  
     Financial Services Act 2013; or

     \(b\) if the person interested in the charge is the Central Bank of Malaysia.

\(7\) For the purposes of _subsection \(6\)_, the charge shall be treated as if it is a charge registered under _subsection \(1\)_ and shall be valid against the liquidator and any creditor of the company.

\(8\) Notwithstanding _subsection \(1\)_, any person interested in the charge may lodge with the Registrar the particulars of the charge before the end of the period allowed for registration.

\(9\) If a registration is effected by any person interested in the charge other than the company, that person shall be entitled to recover from the company the amount of any fees properly paid by that person on the registration.

\(10\) The company and every officer who contravene [_subsection 352\(1\)_](section-352.-registration-of-charges.md) and [section 354](section-354.-registration-of-charges-created-over-property-outside-malaysia.md) commit an offence and shall, on conviction, be liable to a fine not exceeding fifty thousand ringgit and in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding five hundred ringgit for each day during which the offence continues after conviction.
