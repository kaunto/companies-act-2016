# Section 376. Appointment of receiver or receiver and manager by Court

\(1\) The Court may, after giving notice to the company appoint a receiver or receiver and manager on the application of a debenture holder or any other interested person and give notice to the company, where the Court is satisfied that—

     \(a\) the company has failed to pay a debt due to the debenture holder or has otherwise failed to meet  
     any obligation to the debenture holder, or that any principal money borrowed by the company or  
     interest is in arrears;

     \(b\) the company proposes to sell or otherwise dispose of the secured property in breach of the terms  
     of any instrument creating the security or charge; or

     \(c\) it is necessary to appoint a receiver or receiver and manager to ensure the preservation of the  
     secured property for the benefit of the debenture holder.

\(2\) A person appointed as a receiver by the Court may act as a receiver and manager unless the Court order excludes the appointment as receiver and manager.

\(3\) If two or more receivers or receiver and managers are appointed by the Court, unless the Court expressly provides otherwise—

     \(a\) the functions or the powers of the receivers or receiver and managers may be performed or  
     exercised by any one of them or by both or all of them jointly; and

     \(b\) a reference to the receiver or receiver and manager shall be a reference to whichever one of the  
     receivers or receiver and managers.

\(4\) The right of any person to apply to the Court for the appointment of a receiver or receiver and manager under common law is not abrogated by the operation of this section or Subdivision.
