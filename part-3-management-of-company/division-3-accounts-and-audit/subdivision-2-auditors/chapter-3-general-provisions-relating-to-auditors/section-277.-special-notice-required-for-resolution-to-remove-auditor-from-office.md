# Section 277. Special notice required for resolution to remove auditor from office

\(1\) A special notice shall be required for a resolution to remove an auditor from office at a general meeting of a company.

\(2\) Upon receipt of the special notice of such an intended resolution, the company shall immediately send a copy of the notice to the auditor proposed to be removed and the Registrar.

\(3\) The auditor may make a representation in writing not exceeding a reasonable length to the company within seven days from the receipt of the special notice and may request that prior to the meeting at which the resolution is to be considered, a copy of the representation be circulated by the company to every member of the company to whom notice of the meeting is sent.

\(4\) Upon request of the auditor referred to in _subsection \(3\)_, the company shall send a copy of the representation to every member of the company to whom notice of the meeting is sent.

\(5\) If a copy of the representation is not sent as required under _subsection \(4\)_, the auditor may, without prejudice to his right to be heard orally, require that the representation be read out at the meeting.

\(6\) A copy of the representation need not be circulated and the representation need not be read at the meeting if, on the application either of the company or of any other person claiming to be aggrieved, the Court is satisfied that the auditor is using this section to secure needless publicity or the matter is defamatory or some other grounds that the Court thinks reasonable.
