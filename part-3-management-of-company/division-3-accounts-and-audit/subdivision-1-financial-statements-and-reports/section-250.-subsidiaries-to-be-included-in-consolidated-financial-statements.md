# Section 250. Subsidiaries to be included in consolidated financial statements

\(1\) The consolidated financial statements for a financial year shall include all the subsidiaries of a company.

\(2\) Where the consolidated financial statements do not deal with a subsidiary of a company, the directors shall disclose by way of a note on the financial statements the reason for not causing the financial statements for such one or more subsidiaries to be consolidated.

\(3\) In the case of a subsidiary incorporated in a country outside Malaysia, whether it has or has not established a place of business in Malaysia, which country has been declared by the Minister by notification published in the Gazette to be a country to which this section applies, it shall be sufficient if the separate profit and loss account or balance sheet, as the case may require, of the subsidiary is in such form and is so reported upon by auditors and contains such particulars and includes such documents, if any, as the company is required to make out and lay before the company in a general meeting in accordance with the law for the time being applicable to the company in the place where it is incorporated.

\(4\) For the purposes of _subsection \(1\)_, the holding company shall have the power to request all relevant information from its subsidiaries to secure compliance under this section.

\(5\) Any director who fails to take all reasonable steps to secure compliance under _subsection \(1\)_ commits an offence.
