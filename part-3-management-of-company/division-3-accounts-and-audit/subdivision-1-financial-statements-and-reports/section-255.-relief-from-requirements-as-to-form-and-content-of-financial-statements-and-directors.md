# Section 255. Relief from requirements as to form and content of financial statements and directors’~

\(1\) The directors of a company may apply to the Registrar in writing for an order relieving the directors from any requirement of this Act relating to the form and content of the financial statements or consolidated financial statements or to the form and content of the directors’ report required under [sections 252](section-252.-directors-shall-prepare-directors-report.md) and [253](section-253.-contents-of-directors-report.md) and the Registrar may make such an order either unconditionally or on condition that the directors comply with such other requirements relating to the form and content of the financial statements or consolidated financial statements or directors’ report as the Registrar thinks fit to impose.

\(2\) The application for a relief order under _subsection \(1\)_ shall not be granted if the Registrar is of the opinion that the order is not consistent with the approved accounting standards.

\(3\) The Registrar may where he considers it appropriate make an order in respect of any class of companies relieving the directors of a company in that class from compliance with any specified requirements of this Act relating to the form and content of financial statements or consolidated financial statements or to the form and content of the directors’ report required by [sections 252](section-252.-directors-shall-prepare-directors-report.md) and [253](section-253.-contents-of-directors-report.md).

\(4\) The order under subsection \(3\) may be made either unconditionally or on condition that the directors of the company comply with such other requirements relating to the form and content of financial statements or consolidated financial statements or directors’ report as the Registrar thinks fit to impose.

\(5\) The Registrar shall not make an order under _subsection \(1\)_ unless he is of the opinion that compliance with the requirements of this Act would—

     \(a\) render the financial statements or consolidated financial statements or directors’ report, as the  
     case may be, misleading or inappropriate to the circumstances of the company; or

     \(b\) impose unreasonable burdens on the company or any officer of the company.

\(6\) The Registrar may make an order under _subsection \(1\)_ or _\(2\)_ which may be limited to a specific period and may make a decision to vary, suspend or revoke any such order on the application by the directors or without any such application, in which case the Registrar shall give to the directors an opportunity to be heard.
