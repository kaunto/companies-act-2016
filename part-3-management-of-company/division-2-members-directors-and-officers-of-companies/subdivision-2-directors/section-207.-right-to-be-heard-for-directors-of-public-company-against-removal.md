# Section 207. Right to be heard for directors of public company against removal

\(1\) On receipt of special notice for a resolution to remove a director under [_subsection 206\(3\)_](section-206.-removal-of-directors.md), the company shall forthwith send to the director a copy of the special notice.

\(2\) The director shall be given the right to make oral representation or written representation not exceeding a reasonable length on the resolution to remove him.

\(3\) Where the director makes written representation and requests the written representation be notified to the members, the company shall, unless the representation is received too late for the company to do so—

     \(a\) state the fact of the representation having been made in the notice of the resolution given to  
     members of the company; and

     \(b\) send a copy of the representation to every member of the company to whom the notice of the  
     meeting is sent.

\(4\) If a copy of the representations is not sent as required under _subsection \(3\)_ due to the representations received too late by the company or due to the default of the company, the director may, without prejudice to his right to be heard orally, require that the representations shall be read out at the meeting.

\(5\) Copies of the representations need not be sent out and the representations need not be read out at the meeting if, on the application either of the company or of any other person who claims to be aggrieved, the Court is satisfied that the rights conferred by this section are being abused.

\(6\) The Court may order the company’s costs on an application under _subsection \(5\)_ to be paid in whole or in part by the director, notwithstanding that he is not a party to the application.

\(7\) The constitution of a private company may provide the rights accorded under this section to its directors.
