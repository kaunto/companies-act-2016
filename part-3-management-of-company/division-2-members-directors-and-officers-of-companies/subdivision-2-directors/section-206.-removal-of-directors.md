# Section 206. Removal of directors

\(1\) A director may be removed before the expiration of the director’s period of office as follows:

     \(a\) subject to the constitution, in the case of a private company, by ordinary resolution; or

     \(b\) in the case of a public company, in accordance with this section.

\(2\) Notwithstanding anything in the constitution or any agreement between a public company and a director, the company may by ordinary resolution at a meeting remove the director before the expiration of the director’s tenure of office.

\(3\) Special notice is required of a resolution to remove a director under this section or to appoint another person instead of the director at the same meeting.

\(4\) Notwithstanding _paragraph \(1\)\(b\)_, if a director of a public company was appointed to represent the interests of any particular class of shareholders or debenture holders, the resolution to remove the director shall not take effect until the director’s successor has been appointed.

\(5\) A person appointed as director in place of a person removed under this section shall be treated, for the purpose of determining the time at which he or any other director is to retire, as if he had become a director on the day on which the person in whose place he is appointed was last appointed a director.
