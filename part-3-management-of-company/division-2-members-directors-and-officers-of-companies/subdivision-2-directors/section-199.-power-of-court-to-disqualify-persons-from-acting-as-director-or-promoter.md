\(1\) The Court may, on an application by the Registrar, make an order to disqualify any person from acting or holding office as a director or promoter of a company, or be concerned with or taking part in the management of a company whether directly or indirectly, if—

     \(a\) within the last five years, the person has been a director of two or more companies which went into  
     liquidation resulting from the company being insolvent due to his conduct as a director which  
     contributed wholly or partly to the liquidation;

     \(b\) due to his contravention of the duties of a director; or

     \(c\) due to his habitual contravention of this Act.

\(2\) An application arising from the circumstances referred to in _paragraph \(1\)\(a\)_ may be made by the Official Receiver and the Registrar shall be made a party to the proceedings.

\(3\) Before making an order under _subsection \(1\)_, the Court may require any person—

     \(a\) to furnish the Court with such information with respect to the company’s affairs; and

     \(b\) to produce and permit inspection of such books or documents relevant to the company.

\(4\) After considering the application and the additional information and documents received under _subsection \(3\)_, if any, the Court may make an order to disqualify the person from acting or holding office as a director or promoter of a company, or be concerned with or taking part in the management of a company whether directly or indirectly for such period not exceeding five years commencing from the date of the order.

\(5\) The Registrar or the Official Receiver shall give notice of not less than fourteen days to the person referred to in _subsection \(1\)_ notifying his intention to apply for an order under this section.
