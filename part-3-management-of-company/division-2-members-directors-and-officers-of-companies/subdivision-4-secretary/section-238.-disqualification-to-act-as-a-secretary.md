# Section 238. Disqualification to act as a secretary

\(1\) A person shall be disqualified to act as a secretary ifâ€”

     \(a\) he is an undischarged bankrupt;

     \(b\) he is convicted whether in or outside Malaysia of any offence referred to in [section 198](../subdivision-2-directors/section-198.-persons-disqualified-from-being-a-director.md); or

     \(c\) he ceases to be a holder of a practicing certificate issued by the Registrar under [section 241](section-241.-requirement-to-register-with-registrar.md).

\(2\) Notwithstanding _subsection \(1\)_, if the Registrar is of the opinion that a person has failed to act honestly or use reasonable diligence in the discharge of his duties as a secretary, the Registrar may require the person to show cause why his practising certificate should not be revoked or why he should not be disqualified from acting as a secretary of a company.

\(3\) If a person continues to act as a secretary for a company after the person is disqualified under this section without leave of the Court, the secretary and every director who knowingly permits the person to act in that capacity commit an offence.
