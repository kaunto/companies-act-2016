# Section 237. Resignation of a secretary

\(1\) Subject to the constitution or the terms of appointment, a secretary may resign from his office by giving a notice to the Board.

\(2\) If none of the directors of the company can be communicated with at the last known residential address, the secretary may, notwithstanding [_subsection 235\(1\)_](section-235.-requirement-for-a-secretary.md), notify the Registrar of that fact and of his intention to resign from the office.

\(3\) The secretary shall cease to be the secretary of the companyâ€”

     \(a\) on the expiry of thirty days from the date of the notice lodged under _subsection \(1\)_ or the period  
     specified in the constitution or the terms of appointment, as the case may be; or

     \(b\) on the expiry of thirty days from the date of the notice to the Registrar under _subsection \(2\)_.

\(4\) Nothing in _subsections \(1\)_ and _\(2\)_ shall relieve the secretary from liability for any act or omission done before the secretary vacated that office.
