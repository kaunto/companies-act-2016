\(2\) Notwithstanding _subsection \(1\)_, the Court shall have the powerâ€”

     \(a\) to order that any other sections in [Subdivision 4 of Division 2 of Part IV](../../../part-4-cessation-of-companies/division-2-provisions-applicable-to-every-winding-up/subdivision-4-offences/) shall apply to a company  
     under judicial management as if the sections in [Subdivision 4 of Division 2 of Part IV](../../../part-4-cessation-of-companies/division-2-provisions-applicable-to-every-winding-up/subdivision-4-offences/) apply in a winding  
     up by the Court; and

     \(b\) any reference to the liquidator shall be taken as a reference to the judicial manager and any  
     reference to a contributory shall be taken as a reference to a member of the company.
