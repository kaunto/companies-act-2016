# Section 429. Inquiry into company’s dealings, etc.

\(1\) The Court may, on the application of the judicial manager, summon to appear before it—

     \(a\) any officer of the company;

     \(b\) any person known or suspected to have in possession any property of the company;

     \(c\) any person who is supposed to be indebted to the company; or

     \(d\) any person whom the Court thinks capable of giving information concerning the promotion,  
     formation, business, dealings, affairs or property of the company,

and the Court may require any such person referred to in _paragraphs \(a\)_ to _\(d\)_ to submit an affidavit to the Court containing an account of his dealings with the company or to produce any books, papers or other records in his possession or under his control relating to the company or the matters mentioned in _paragraph \(d\)._

\(2\) In a case where a person, without reasonable excuse, fails to appear before the Court when he is summoned to do so under this section or there are reasonable grounds for believing that a person has absconded, or is about to abscond, with a view to avoiding his appearance before the Court under this section, the Court may, for the purpose of bringing that person and anything in his possession before the Court, cause a warrant to be issued—

     __\(a\) for the arrest of that person; and

     \(b\) for the seizure of any books, papers, records, money or goods in that person’s possession,

and may authorize a person arrested under such a warrant to be kept in custody, and anything seized under such a warrant to be held until that person is brought before the Court under the warrant or until such other time as the Court may order.

\(3\) Any person who appears or is brought before the Court under this section may be examined on oath, either orally or by interrogatories, concerning the company or the matters mentioned in _paragraph \(1\)\(d\)_.

\(4\) If it appears to the Court, after considering any evidence obtained under this section that any person has in his possession any property of the company, the Court may, on the application of the judicial manager, order that person to surrender the property to the judicial manager at such time, in such manner and on such terms as the Court thinks fit.

\(5\) If it appears to the Court, on consideration of any evidence obtained under this section, that any person is indebted to the company, the Court may, on the application of the judicial manager, after examining that person on the matter, order that person to pay to the judicial manager, at such time and in such manner as the Court may direct, the whole or any part of the amount due, whether in full discharge of the debt or otherwise, as the Court thinks fit.
