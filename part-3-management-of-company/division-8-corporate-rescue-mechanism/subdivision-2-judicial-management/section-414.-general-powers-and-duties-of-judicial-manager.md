# Section 414. General powers and duties of judicial manager

\(1\) On the making of a judicial management order, the judicial manager shall take into his custody or under his control all the property to which the company is or appears to be entitled.

\(2\) During the period for which a judicial management order is in force, all powers conferred and duties imposed on the directors by this Act or by the constitution of the company shall be exercised and performed by the judicial manager and not by the directors, but nothing in this subsection shall require the judicial manager to call any meetings of the company.

\(3\) The judicial manager of a company shall—

     \(a\) do all such things as may be necessary for the management of the affairs, business and property of  
     the company; and

     \(b\) do all such other things as the Court may order.

\(4\) Without prejudice to the generality of _paragraph \(3\)\(a\)_, the powers conferred by that subsection shall include the powers specified in the [Ninth Schedule](../../../part-5-miscellaneous/division-4-saving-and-transitional/section-620.-repeal-and-savings/ninth-schedule.md).

\(5\) The judicial manager may apply to the Court for directions in relation to any particular matter arising in connection with the carrying out of his functions.

\(6\) Nothing in this section shall be taken as authorizing the judicial manager of a company to make any payment towards discharging any debt to which the company was subject on the making of the judicial management order unless—

     \(a\) the making of the payment is sanctioned by the Court or the payment is made under a compromise  
     or arrangement so sanctioned; or

     \(b\) the payment is made towards discharging sums secured by a security or payable under a hire  
     purchase agreement, chattels leasing agreement or retention of title agreement to which [section 415](section-415.-power-to-deal-with-charged-property-etc..md)  
     applies.

\(7\) If a request is made by or with the concurrence of the judicial manager for the giving of any of the supplies including water, electricity, gas and telecommunications, after the making of the judicial management order—

     \(a\) the supplier may make it a condition of the giving of the supply that the judicial manager personally  
     guarantees the payment of any charges in respect of the supply given after the judicial manager’s  
     appointment; or

     \(b\) the supplier shall not make it a condition of the giving of the supply, or do anything which has the  
     effect of making it a condition of the giving of the supply, that any outstanding charges in respect of a  
     supply given to the company before the making of the judicial management order are paid.

\(8\) The judicial manager of a company may summon a meeting of the company’s creditors, if he thinks fit, and shall summon such a meeting if he is directed to do so by the Court.

\(9\) Any alteration in the constitution made by virtue of an order under _paragraph \(3\)\(b\)_ is of the same effect as if duly made by resolution of the company, and the provisions of this Act apply to the constitution as so altered accordingly.

\(10\) The judicial manager shall deliver an office copy of an order sanctioning the alteration of the constitution under _paragraph \(3\)\(b\)_ to the Registrar within fourteen days from the making of the order.

\(11\) A person dealing with the judicial manager of a company in good faith and for value shall not be concerned to inquire whether the judicial manager is acting within his powers.
