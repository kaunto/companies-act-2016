# Section 407. Nomination of judicial manager

\(1\) In any application for a judicial management order under [section 404](section-404.-application-to-court-for-a-company-to-be-placed-under-judicial-management-and-for-appo.md), the applicant shall nominate a person who is an insolvency practitioner, who is not the auditor of the company, to act as a judicial manager.

\(2\) The Court may refuse the nomination of the applicant under _subsection \(1\)_ and may appoint another person who is an insolvency practitioner as the judicial manager.

\(3\) Where a nomination is made by the company under _subsection \(1\)_, a majority in value of the creditors, including contingent or prospective creditors may be heard in opposition to the nomination and the Court may, if satisfied as to the value of the creditors’ claims and as to the grounds of opposition—

     \(a\) invite the creditors to nominate a person who is an insolvency practitioner to act as the judicial  
     manager; and

     \(b\) adopt the nomination if the Court thinks fit.

\(4\) A judicial manager shall be entitled to receive such salary or remuneration by way of percentage or otherwise as is determined—

     \(a\) by agreement between the judicial manager and the company or creditors, as the case may be;

     \(b\) failing such agreement, by a resolution passed at a meeting of creditors by a majority of not less  
     than seventy-five per centum in value and of the creditors present in person or by proxy and voting at  
     the meeting and whose debts have been admitted to vote, which meeting shall be convened by the  
     judicial manager by a notice to each creditor to which notice shall be attached a statement of all  
     receipts and expenditure by the judicial manager and the amount of remuneration sought by him; or

     \(c\) failing a determination in a manner referred to in _paragraph \(a\)_ or _\(b\)_, by the Court.
