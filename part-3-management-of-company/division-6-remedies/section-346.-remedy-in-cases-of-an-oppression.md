# Section 346. Remedy in cases of an oppression

\(1\) Any member or debenture holder of a company may apply to the Court for an order under this section on the ground—

     \(a\) that the affairs of the company are being conducted or the powers of the directors are being  
     exercised in a manner oppressive to one or more of the members or debenture holders including  
     himself or in disregard of his or their interests as members, shareholders or debenture holders of the  
     company; or

     \(b\) that some act of the company has been done or is threatened or that some resolution of the  
     members, debenture holders or any class of them has been passed or is proposed which unfairly  
     discriminates against or is otherwise prejudicial to one or more of the members or debenture holders,  
     including himself.

\(2\) If on such application the Court is of the opinion that either of those grounds is established, the Court may make such order as the Court thinks fit with the view to bringing to an end or remedying the matters complained of, and without prejudice to the generality of _subsection \(1\)_, the order may—

     \(a\) direct or prohibit any actor cancel or vary any transaction or resolution;

     \(b\) regulate the conduct of the affairs of the company in the future;

     \(c\) provide for the purchase of the shares or debentures of the company by other members or  
     debenture holders of the company or by the company itself;

     \(d\) in the case of a purchase of shares by the company, provide for a reduction accordingly of capital of  
     the company; or

     \(e\) provide that the company be wound up.

\(3\) If an order that the company be wound up is made under _paragraph \(2\)\(e\)_, the provisions of this Act relating to winding up of a company shall apply as if the order had been made upon a petition duly presented to the Court by the company, with such adaptations as are necessary.

\(4\) If an order under this section makes any alteration in or addition to any constitution, then, notwithstanding anything in any other provision of this Act, but subject to the order, the company concerned shall not have power without the leave of the Court to make any further alteration in or addition to the constitution inconsistent with the order, but subject to the foregoing provisions of this subsection, the alterations or additions made by the order shall be of the same effect as if duly made by resolution of the company.

\(5\) An office copy of any order made under this section shall be lodged by the applicant with the Registrar within fourteen days from the making of the order.

\(6\) The applicant who contravenes _subsection \(5\)_ commits an offence and shall, on conviction, be liable to a fine not exceeding ten thousand ringgit and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine of five hundred ringgit for each day during which the offence continues after conviction.
