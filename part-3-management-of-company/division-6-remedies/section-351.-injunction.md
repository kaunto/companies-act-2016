     \(b\) an attempt to contravene this Act;

     \(c\) an attempt that aids, abets, advises or procures a person to contravene this Act;

     \(d\) an attempt to induce, whether by threats, promises or otherwise, a person to contravene this Act;

     \(e\) an attempt by which any person would be in any way, directly or indirectly, knowingly concerned in,  
     or party to, the contravention by a person of this Act; or

     \(f\) an attempt of conspiracy with others to contravene this Act,

the Court may, on the application of the Registrar, or of a person whose interests have been, are or would be affected by the conduct, grant an injunction, on such terms as the Court thinks appropriate, restraining the first-mentioned person from engaging in the conduct and, if in the opinion of the Court it is desirable to do so, requiring that person to do any act or thing.

\(2\) If a person refused or failed, is refusing or failing, to do an act or thing that the person is required by this Act to do, the Court may, on the application of the Registrar or any person whose interests have been, are or would be affected by the refusal or failure to do that act or thing, grant an injunction, on such terms as the Court thinks appropriate, requiring the person who refused or failed, is refusing or failing, to do that act or thing.

\(3\) The power of the Court to grant an injunction to restrain a person from engaging in conduct may be exercised whether or not—

     \(a\) it appears to the Court that the person intends to engage again or to continue to engage, in conduct  
     of that kind;

     \(b\) the person has previously engaged in conduct of that kind; or

     \(c\) there is an imminent danger of substantial damage to any person if such person engages in a  
     conduct of that kind.

\(4\) The power of the Court to grant an injunction requiring a person to do an act or thing may be exercised whether or not—

     \(a\) it appears to the Court that the person intends to refuse or fail again, or to continue to refuse or fail,  
     to do that act or thing;

     \(b\) the person has previously refused or failed to do that act or thing; or

     \(c\) there is an imminent danger of substantial damage to any person if such person refuses or fails to  
     do that act or thing.

\(5\) Where the Registrar applies to the Court for the grant of an injunction under this section, the Court shall not require the applicant or any other person to give an undertaking as to damages as a condition for the granting of an interim injunction.

\(6\) Where an application for an injunction under _subsection \(1\)_ or _\(2\)_ has been made, the Court may grant an injunction by consent of all parties to the proceedings, if the Court determines it to be appropriate, whether or not the Court is satisfied that that subsection applies.

\(7\) The Court may grant an interim injunction pending determination of an application under _subsection \(1\)_ if in the opinion of the Court it is desirable to do so.

\(8\) The Court may revoke or vary an injunction granted under _subsection \(1\)_, _\(2\)_ or _\(7\)_.

\(9\) In granting an injunction to restrain a person from engaging in particular conduct, or to require a person to do a particular act or thing, the Court may order that person to pay damages to any other person, either in addition to or in substitution of the grant of the injunction.
