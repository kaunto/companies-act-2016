# Section 100. Numbering of shares

\(1\) Where a company issues share certificates, each share shall be distinguished by an appropriate number, except as provided by _subsection \(2\)_ or _\(3\)_.

\(2\) Ifâ€”

     \(a\) all the issued shares in a company are fully paid up and rank equally for all purposes; or

     \(b\) all the issued shares of a particular class in a company are fully paid up and rank equally for all  
     purposes,

none of those shares is required to have a distinguishing number as long as it remains fully paid up and ranks equally for all purposes with all shares of the same class issued and fully paid up.

\(3\) If new shares are issued by a company on the terms that, within a period not exceeding twelve months, the new shares will rank equally for all purposes with all the existing shares or with all the existing shares of a particular class, in the company, neither the new shares nor the existing shares are required to have distinguishing numbers as long as all of the shares are fully paid up and rank equally for all purposes.
