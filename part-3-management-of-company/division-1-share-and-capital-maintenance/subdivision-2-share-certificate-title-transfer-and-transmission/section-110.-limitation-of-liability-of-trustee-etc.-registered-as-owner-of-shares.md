\(1\) Any trustee, executor or administrator of the estate of any deceased person who was registered in a register or branch register kept in Malaysia as the holder of a share in any corporation may become registered as the holder of that share as trustee, executor or administrator of that estate and shall, in respect of that share, be subject to the same liabilities and no more as he would have been subject to if the share had remained registered in the name of the deceased person.

\(2\) Any trustee, executor or administrator of the estate of any deceased person who was beneficially entitled to a share in any corporation, being a share registered in a register or branch register kept in Malaysia may, with the consent of the corporation and of the registered holder of that share, become registered as the holder of the share as trustee, executor or administrator of that estate and shall, in respect of the share, be subject to the same liabilities and no more as he would have been subject to if the share had been registered in the name of the deceased person.

\(3\) Shares in a corporation registered in a register or branch register kept in Malaysia and held by a trustee in respect of a particular trust may, with the consent of the corporation, be marked in the register or branch register in such a way as to identify the shares as being held in respect of the trust.

\(4\) Except as provided in this Act, no notice of any trust expressed, implied or constructive shall be entered on a register or branch register or be receivable by the Registrar and no liabilities shall be affected by anything done under _subsection \(1\)_, _\(2\)_ or _\(3\)_ or under the law of any other place which corresponds to this section and the corporation concerned shall not be affected with notice of any trust by anything so done.
