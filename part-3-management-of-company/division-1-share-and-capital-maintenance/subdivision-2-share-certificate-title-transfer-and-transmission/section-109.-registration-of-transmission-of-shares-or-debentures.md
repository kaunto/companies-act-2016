# Section 109. Registration of transmission of shares or debentures

\(1\) This section applies if the right to shares or debentures is transmitted to a person by operation of law and the person notifies the company in writing that the person wishes to be registered as a shareholder or debenture holder of the company in respect of the shares or debentures.

\(2\) Notwithstanding _subsection \(1\)_, if the person referred to in that subsection elects to have another person registered, he shall testify his election by executing to that person a transfer of the share or debenture, as the case may be.

\(3\) All limitations, restrictions and provisions of this Subdivision relating to the right to transfer and the registration of transfers of shares or debentures referred to in _subsection \(2\)_ shall be applicable to any notice or transfer as if the death or bankruptcy of the shareholder or debenture holder had not occurred and the notice or transfer were signed by that shareholder or debenture holder.

\(4\) Any document which is by law sufficient evidence of probate of the will or letters of administration of the estate of a deceased person having been granted to a person shall be accepted by the company as sufficient evidence of the grant.

\(5\) The company shall register the person as a shareholder or debenture holder of the company in respect of the shares or debentures within sixty days from receiving the notification.

\(6\) The registration of transmission of shares or debentures under this section shall entitle the registered holder to the same dividends and other advantages and to the same rights in relation to meetings of the company or to voting or otherwise.

\(7\) For the purposes of _subsection \(1\)_, in case of the death of a member, the persons recognized as having any title to his interest in the shares or debentures shall beâ€”

     \(a\) where the deceased was a sole holder, the legal personal representatives; and

     \(b\) where the deceased was a joint holder, the survivor,

but nothing in this section shall release the estate of a deceased joint holder from any liability in respect of any share which had been jointly held by him with other persons.

\(8\) The company and every officer who contravene this section commit an offence and shall, on conviction, be liable to a fine not exceeding ten thousand ringgit and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding five hundred ringgit for each day during which the offence continues after conviction.
