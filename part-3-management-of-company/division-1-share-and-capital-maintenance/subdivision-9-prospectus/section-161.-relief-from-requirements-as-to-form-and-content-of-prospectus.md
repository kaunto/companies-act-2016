# Section 161. Relief from requirements as to form and content of prospectus

\(1\) The Registrar may, on the application in writing by any person required to comply with [_subsection 154\(1\)_](section-154.-requirement-to-register-and-lodge-prospectus.md), relieve the person or approve any variation from the requirements of this Act relating to the form and content of a prospectus.

\(2\) In granting the relief or approving the variation under _subsection \(1\)_, the Registrar may impose such terms and conditions as the Registrar thinks fit.

\(3\) The Registrar shall not grant the relief or approve the variation under _subsection \(1\)_ unless he has considered the nature and objectives of the corporation and is satisfied thatâ€”

     \(a\) the relief or variation does not cause the non-disclosure to the public of information necessary for  
     the assessment of the investment in the shares or debentures of the corporation, as the case may be;  
     and

     \(b\) the compliance with the requirements, for which the relief or variation is applied for, would impose  
     unreasonable burden on the applicant.

\(4\) A prospectus shall be deemed to have complied with all the requirements of this Act relating to the form and content of a prospectus if the prospectus is issued in compliance with _subsection \(1\)_.
