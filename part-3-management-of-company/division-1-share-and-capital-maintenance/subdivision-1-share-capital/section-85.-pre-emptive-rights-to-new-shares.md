# Section 85. Pre-emptive rights to new shares

\(1\) Subject to the constitution, where a company issues shares which rank equally to existing shares as to voting or distribution rights, those shares shall first be offered to the holders of existing shares in a manner which would, if the offer were accepted, maintain the relative voting and distribution rights of those shareholders.

\(2\) An offer under _subsection \(1\)_ shall be made to the holders of existing shares in a notice specifying the number of shares offered and the time frame of the offer within which the offer, if not accepted, is deemed to be declined.

\(3\) If the offer is not accepted after the expiry of the period specified in the notice under _subsection \(2\)_, the directors may dispose those shares in such manner as the directors think most beneficial to the company.
