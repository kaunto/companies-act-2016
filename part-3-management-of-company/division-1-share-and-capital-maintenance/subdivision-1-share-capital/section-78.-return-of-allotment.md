     \(b\) the amount, if any, paid, deemed to be paid, or due and payable on the allotment of each share;

     which each share comprised in the allotment belongs; and

     \(d\) the full name and the address of each of the allottees and the number and class of shares allotted  
     to him.

\(3\) The particulars mentioned in _paragraph \(2\)\(d\)_ need not be included in the return of the allotment of a public company to which [_subsection 68\(7\)_](../../../part-2-formation-and-administration-of-companies/division-10-annual-return/section-68.-duty-to-lodge-annual-return.md) applies which has allotted shares—

\(4\) Where shares are allotted or deemed to have been allotted as fully or partly paid up otherwise than in cash and the allotment is made under a contract in writing, the company shall lodge together with the return the contract evidencing the entitlement of the allottee or a copy of any such contract certified in a manner as may be determined by the Registrar.

\(5\) If a certified copy of a contract is lodged, the original contract duly stamped shall be produced at the same time to the Registrar if requested by the Registrar.

\(6\) Where shares are allotted or are deemed to have been allotted as fully or partly paid up otherwise than in cash and the allotment is made—

     \(a\) under a contract not reduced to writing;

     \(b\) under the constitution;

     \(c\) in satisfaction of a dividend declared in favour of, but not payable in cash to the shareholders; or

     \(d\) upon the application of moneys held by the company in an account or reserve in paying up unissued  
     shares to which the shareholders have become entitled,

the company shall lodge together with the return a statement containing such particulars as may be determined by the Registrar.

\(7\) Where shares are allotted under a scheme of arrangement approved by the Court under [section 366](../../division-7-charges-arrangement-and-reconstructions-and-receivership/subdivision-2-arrangements-and-reconstructions/section-366.-power-of-court-to-order-compromise-or-arrangement-with-creditors-and-members.md), the company may lodge an office copy of the order of the Court in lieu of the statement referred to in _subsection \(6\)_ in a manner as may be determined by the Registrar.

\(8\) Any shares issued to any person without formal allotment for the purpose of incorporation of a company shall be deemed to have been allotted on the date of the incorporation.

\(9\) The company and every officer who contravene this section commit an offence and shall, on conviction, be liable to a fine not exceeding ten thousand ringgit and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding five hundred ringgit for each day during which the offence continues after conviction.
