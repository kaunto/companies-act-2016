# Section 89. Classes of shares

\(1\) For the purposes of this Act, shares are in the same class if the rights attached to the shares are identical in all respects.

\(2\) Subject to the constitution of a company, the rights attached to shares are not to be regarded as different from those attached to other shares in the same class only because they do not carry the same rights to dividends in the twelve months immediately following the allotment.
