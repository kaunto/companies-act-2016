\(2\) The Court shall make an order cancelling the resolution if, at the time the application is considered, the resolution has not been cancelled previously, any debt or claim on which the application was based is outstanding and the Court is satisfied that—

     \(a\) the debt or claim has not been secured and the applicant does not have other adequate safeguards
