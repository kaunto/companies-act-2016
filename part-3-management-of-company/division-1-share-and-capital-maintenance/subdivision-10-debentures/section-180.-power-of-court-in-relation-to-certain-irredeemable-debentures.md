# Section 180. Power of Court in relation to certain irredeemable debentures

\(1\) Notwithstanding anything in any debenture or trust deed, the security for any debentures which are irredeemable or redeemable only on the happening of a contingency shall, if the Court so orders, be enforceable, forthwith or at such other time as the Court directs.

\(2\) In making an order under _subsection \(1\)_, on the application by the trustee for the debenture holders or where there is no trustee, by the holder of any of the debentures, the Court shall be satisfied thatâ€”

     \(a\) at the time of the issue of the debentures the assets of the corporation which constituted or were  
     intended to constitute the security therefor were sufficient or likely to become sufficient to discharge  
     the principal debt and any interest on the debt;

     \(b\) the security, if realized under the circumstances existing at the time of the application, would be  
     likely to bring not more than sixty per centum of the principal sum of moneys outstanding regard being  
     had to all prior charges and charges ranking equally, if any; and

     \(c\) the assets covered by the security, on a fair valuation on the basis of a going concern after allowing  
     a reasonable amount for depreciation are worth less than the principal sum and the borrowing  
     corporation is not making sufficient profit to pay the interest due on the principal sum or where no  
     definite rate of interest is payable, interest on the sum at such rate as the Court considers would be a  
     fair rate to expect from a similar investment.

\(3\) _Subsection \(1\)_ shall not affect any power to vary rights or accept any compromise or arrangement created by the terms of the debentures or the relevant trust deed or under a compromise or arrangement between the borrowing corporation and creditors.
