# Section 330. Declaration by chairperson on a show of hands

\(1\) At any meeting of members, a resolution put to the vote of the meeting shall be decided on a show of hands unless before or on the declaration of the result of the show of hands, a poll is demandedâ€”

     \(a\) by the chairman;

     \(b\) by at least three members present in person or by proxy;

     \(c\) by any member present in person or by proxy and representing not less than ten per centum of the  
     total voting rights of all the members having the right to vote at the meeting; or

     \(d\) by a member holding shares in the company conferring a right to vote at the meeting being shares  
     on which an aggregate sum has been paid up equal to not less than ten per centum of the total paid up  
     shares conferring that right.

\(2\) On a vote on a resolution at a meeting on a show of hands, a declaration by the chairperson that the resolution has been passed unanimously or with a particular majority or is lost, and an entry to that effect in the minutes of the proceeding shall be conclusive evidence of that fact without proof of the number or proportion of the votes recorded in favour of or against the resolution.

\(3\) An entry in respect of such a declaration in the minutes of the meeting recorded in accordance with [section 343](../subdivision-9-record-of-resolutions-and-meetings/section-343.-records-as-evidence-of-resolutions.md) is conclusive evidence of that fact.

\(4\) This section does not have effect if a poll is demanded in respect of the resolution, and the demand is not subsequently withdrawn.
