# Section 333. Representation of corporations at meetings of members

\(1\) If a corporation is a member of a company, the corporation may by resolution of its Board or other governing body authorize a person or persons to act as its representative or representatives at any meeting of members of the company.

\(2\) If the corporation authorizes only one person, the person shall be entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the corporation as the corporation could exercise if he was an individual member of the company.

\(3\) If the corporation authorizes more than one person as its representative, every one of the representative is entitled to exercise the same powers on behalf of the corporation as the corporation could exercise if every one of the representative was an individual member of the company.

\(4\) If the corporation authorizes more than one person and more than one of the representatives purport to exercise the power under _subsection \(3\)_â€”

     \(a\) if the representatives purport to exercise the power in the same way, the power is treated as  
     exercised in that way; or

     \(b\) if the representatives do not purport to exercise the power in the same way, the power is treated as  
     not exercised.

\(5\) A certificate of authorization by the corporation shall be prima facie evidence of the appointment or the revocation of the appointment, as the case may be, of a representative under this section.
