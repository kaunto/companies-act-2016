# Section 332. Voting on a poll

\(1\) On a poll taken at a meeting of members of a company, a member entitled to more than one vote need not, if he votes, use all his votes or cast all the votes he uses in the same way.

\(2\) If a poll is duly demanded, it shall be taken either forthwith or after an interval or adjournment or otherwise as the chairman directs, and the result of the poll shall be the resolution of the meeting at which the poll was demanded, but a poll demanded on the election of a chairman or on a question of adjournment shall be taken forthwith.
