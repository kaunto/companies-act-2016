# Section 325. Power of Court to order non-circulation of members’ statement

\(1\) A company shall not be required to circulate a member’s statement under [section 324](section-324.-directors-duty-to-circulate-members-statement.md) if, on an application by the company or any person who claims to be aggrieved, the Court is satisfied that the rights conferred by [section 323](section-323.-power-of-members-to-require-circulation-of-statements.md) are being abused to secure needless publicity or the matter is defamatory, frivolous or vexatious or if the circulation would not be in the best interest of the company.

\(2\) The Court may order the company’s costs on an application by the company to be paid in whole, or in part by the requisitionists, notwithstanding that they are not parties to the application.
