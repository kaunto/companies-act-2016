# Section 305. Application not to circulate a member’s written resolution

\(1\) A company shall not be required to circulate a member’s written resolution under [_subsection 303\(1\)_](section-303.-circulation-of-written-resolution-proposed-by-members.md) if, on an application by the company or a person who claims to be aggrieved, the Court is satisfied that the rights conferred by [section 302](section-302.-members-power-to-require-circulation-of-written-resolution.md) are being abused.

\(2\) The Court may order any member who requested the circulation of the written resolution to pay the whole or part of the company’s costs on such an application, even if the member is not a party to the application.
