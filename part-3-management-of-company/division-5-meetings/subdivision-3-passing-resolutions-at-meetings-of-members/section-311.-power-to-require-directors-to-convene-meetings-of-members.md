# Section 311. Power to require directors to convene meetings of members

\(1\) The members of a company may require the directors to convene a meeting of members of the company.

\(2\) A requisition under _subsection \(1\)_—

     \(a\) shall be in hard copy or electronic form;

     \(b\) shall state the general nature of the business to be dealt with at the meeting;

     \(c\) may include the text of a resolution that may properly be moved and is intended to be moved at the  
     meeting; and

     \(d\) shall be signed or authenticated by the person making the requisition.

\(3\) The directors shall call for a meeting of members once the company has received requisition to do so from—

     \(a\) members representing at least ten per centum of the paid up capital of the company carrying the  
     right of voting at meetings of members of the company, excluding any paid up capital held as treasury  
     shares; or

     \(b\) in the case of a company not having a share capital, members who represent at least five per  
     centum of the total voting rights of all members having a right of voting at meetings of members.

\(4\) Notwithstanding _subsection \(3\)_, in the case of a private company, members representing at least five per centum of the paid up capital of the company carrying the right of voting at meeting of members of the company may require a meeting of members to be convened if more than twelve months has elapsed since the end of the last meeting of members convened pursuant to a requisition under this section and the proposed resolution is not defamatory, vexatious or frivolous.

\(5\) A resolution may properly be moved at a meeting unless the resolution—

     \(a\) if passed, would be ineffective whether by reason of inconsistency with any written law or the  
     constitution;

     \(b\) is defamatory of any person;

     \(c\) is frivolous or vexatious; or

     \(d\) if passed, would not be in the best interest of the company.

\(6\) For the purposes of _subsections \(3\)_ and _\(4\)_, the right of voting shall be determined at the date the requisition is deposited with the company.
