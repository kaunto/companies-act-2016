# Section 313. Power of members to convene meeting of members at company’s expense

\(1\) If the directors—

     \(a\) are required under [section 311](section-311.-power-to-require-directors-to-convene-meetings-of-members.md) to call a meeting of members; and

     \(b\) do not do so in accordance with [section 312](section-312.-directors-duty-to-call-meetings-required-by-members.md),

the members who requisitioned the meeting, or any of the members representing more than one half of the total voting rights of all of the members who requisitioned the meeting, may call for a meeting of members.

\(2\) Where the requisition received by the company included the text of a resolution intended to be moved at the meeting, the notice of the meeting shall include the text of the resolution.

\(3\) The meeting shall be convened on a date not more than three months after the date on which the directors received a requisition under [_subsection 311\(1\)_](section-311.-power-to-require-directors-to-convene-meetings-of-members.md) to call for a meeting of members.

\(4\) The meeting shall be convened in the same manner, as nearly as possible, as that in which meetings are requisitioned to be convened by directors of the company.

\(5\) The business which may be dealt with at the meeting includes a resolution of which notice is given in accordance with this section.

\(6\) Any reasonable expenses incurred by the members requisitioning the meeting by reason of the failure of the directors to call a meeting shall be reimbursed by the company.

\(7\) Any sum so reimbursed shall be retained by the company out of any sums due or to become due from the company by way of fees or other remuneration in respect of the services of the directors as who were in default.
