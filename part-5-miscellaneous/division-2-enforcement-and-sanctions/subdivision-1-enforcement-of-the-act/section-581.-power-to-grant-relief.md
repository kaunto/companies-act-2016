# Section 581. Power to grant relief

\(1\) In any proceeding for negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust against any person to whom this section applies, if it appears to the Court before which the proceedings are taken that a person is or may be liable, but that he has acted honestly and reasonably and that, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, he ought fairly to be excused for the negligence, default or breach, the Court may relieve him either wholly or partly from his liability on such terms as the Court thinks fit.

\(2\) If any person to whom this section applies has reason to apprehend that any claim will or might be made against him in respect of any negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust, he may apply to the Court for relief, and the Court shall have the same power to relieve him as under this section it would have had if it had been a Court before which proceedings against him for negligence, default, breach of duty or breach of trust had been brought.

\(3\) This section applies toâ€”

     \(a\)  an officer of a corporation;

     \(b\)  a person employed by a corporation as an auditor,whether he is or is not an officer of the   
     corporation;

     \(c\)  an expert within the meaning of this Act;

     \(d\)  a liquidator or person who is appointed by the Court, receiver, receiver and manager or judicial   
     manager that carries out any duty under this Act in relation to a corporation; and

     \(e\)  a nominee appointed under a voluntary arrangement to carry out any duty under this Act in relation   
     to a corporation.
