     \(a\)  the profits or losses of the business in respect of each of the five financial years immediately

     \(b\)  the assets and liabilities of the business at the last date to which the accounts of the business    
     were made.

     \(2\) If the other corporation has no subsidiaries, the report referred to in _subparagraph \(1\)_ shall—

          \(a\)  so far as regards profits and losses, deal with the profits or losses of the other corporation in    
          respect of each of the five financial years immediately preceding the delivery of the statement to          
          the Registrar; and           

          \(b\)  so far as regards assets and liabilities, deal with the assets and liabilities of the other   
          corporation at the last date to which the accounts of the corporation were made.        

   \(3\) If the other corporation has subsidiaries, the report referred to in _subparagraph \(1\)_ shall—

          a\) so far as regards profits and losses, deal separately with the other corporation’s profits or    
          losses as provided by _subparagraph \(2\)_, and in addition deal as mentioned earlier either—  

               \(i\) as a whole with the combined profits or losses of its subsidiaries; or     

              \(ii\) individually with the profits or losses of each subsidiary, or, instead of dealing separately    
               with the other corporation’s profits or losses, deal as aforesaid as a whole with the profits or   
               losses of the other corporation and with the combined profits or losses of its subsidiaries; and             

          \(b\) with regards to assets and liabilities, deal separately with the other corporation’s assets and     
          liabilities as provided by _subparagraph \(2\)_, and, in addition, deal as mentioned earlier either—     

               ****\(i\)  as a whole with the combined assets and liabilities of its subsidiaries, with or without the    
               other corporation’s assets and liabilities; or          

               \(ii\)  individually with the assets and liabilities of each subsidiary,
