# Section 602. Rectification of registers

\(1\) A person may apply to the Registrar for the rectification of a register if an entry in the register—

     \(a\)  contains any matter contrary to law;

     \(b\)  contains any matter that, in a material particular, is false or misleading in the form or context in   
     which the matter is included;

     \(c\)  by reason of an omission or misdescription has not been duly completed; or

     \(d\)  is incorrect or erroneous.

\(2\) Upon receipt of the application under _subsection \(1\)_, in order for the Registrar to decide whether to approve or refuse the application, the Registrar may—

     a\)  require the applicant to produce any document or to furnish any information as the Registrar thinks                                                
     necessary in order for the Registrar to rectify the entry; or

    \(b\)  require the applicant to give notice of that application to such other person as the Registrar may                                      
     specify, being a person who appears to the Registrar to be concerned or to have an interest in the   
     business.

\(3\) Notwithstanding _subsection \(1\)_, the Registrar may refuse any application if the error, mistake or omission does not arise in the ordinary course of the discharge of the duties of the Registrar.

\(4\) Any person aggrieved with the decision of the Registrar under this section may appeal to the Court.

\(5\) Any order made by the Court shall be lodged with the Registrar and where the Court makes an order of rectification, the Registrar shall rectify the register accordingly on receipt of the order.

\(6\) The Registrar may, without an application being made under _subsection \(1\)_, rectify the register if, in his view, an entry—

     \(a\)  contains any matter contrary to law;

     \(b\)  contains any matter that, in a material particular, is false or misleading in the form or context in                                                                           
     which the matter is included;

     \(c\)  by reason of an omission or misdescription has not been duly completed; or

     \(d\)  is incorrect or erroneous.
