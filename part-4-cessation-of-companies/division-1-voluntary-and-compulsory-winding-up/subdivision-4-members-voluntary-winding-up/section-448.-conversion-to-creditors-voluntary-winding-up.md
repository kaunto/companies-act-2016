# Section 448. Conversion to creditors’ voluntary winding up

As from the day on which the creditors’ meeting is held under [section 447](section-447.-duty-of-liquidator-to-call-for-creditors-meeting-in-case-of-insolvency.md), this Act has effect as if—

     \(a\) the directors’ declaration under [section 443](../subdivision-3-voluntary-winding-up/section-443.-declaration-of-solvency.md) had not been made; and

     \(b\) the creditors’ meeting and the company meeting at which it was resolved that the company be  
     wound up voluntarily,

and accordingly the winding up becomes a creditors’ voluntary winding up.
