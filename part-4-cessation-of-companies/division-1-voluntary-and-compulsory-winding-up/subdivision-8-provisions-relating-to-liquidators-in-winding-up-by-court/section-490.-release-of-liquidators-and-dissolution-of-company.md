          \(i\) realised all the property of the company or so much as in his opinion can be realised without  
          needlessly protracting the liquidation;

          \(ii\) distributed a final dividend, if any, to the creditors;

          \(iii\) adjusted the rights of the contributories among themselves; and

          \(iv\) made a final return, if any, to the contributories, or
