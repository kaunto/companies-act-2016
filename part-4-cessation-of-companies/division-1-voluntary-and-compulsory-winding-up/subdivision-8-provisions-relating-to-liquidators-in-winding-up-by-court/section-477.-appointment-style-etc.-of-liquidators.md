# Section 477. Appointment, style, etc., of liquidators

\(1\) The following provisions with respect to liquidators shall have effect on a winding up order being made:

     \(a\) if an approved liquidator other than the Official Receiver is not appointed to be the liquidator of the  
     company, the Official Receiver shall by virtue of his office become the interim liquidator and shall  
     continue to act as such until he or another person becomes liquidator and is capable of acting as such;

     \(b\) if there is no liquidator appointed, the Official Receiver shall summon separate meetings of the  
     creditors and contributories of the company for the purpose of determining whether or not an  
     application is to be made to the Court for appointing a liquidator in the place of the Official Receiver;

     \(c\) the Court may make any appointment and order required to give effect to any such determination,  
     and, if there is a difference between the determinations of the meetings of the creditors and  
     contributories in respect of the matter aforesaid, the Court shall decide the difference and make such  
     order as the Court may think fit;

     \(d\) in a case where a liquidator is not appointed by the Court, the Official Receiver shall be the  
     liquidator of the company;

     \(e\) the Official Receiver shall by virtue of his office be the liquidator during any vacancy;

     \(f\) any vacancy in the office of a liquidator appointed by the Court may be filled by the Court;

     \(g\) a liquidator shall be described, where a person other than the Official Receiver is the liquidator, by  
     the style of “the liquidator”, and, where the Official Receiver is the liquidator, by the style of “the Official  
     Receiver and liquidator”, of the particular company in respect of which he is appointed, and not by his  
     individual name.
