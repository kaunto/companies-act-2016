# Section 483. Custody and vesting of company’s property

\(1\) Where an interim liquidator has been appointed or a winding up order has been made, the interim liquidator or liquidator shall forthwith take into his custody or under his control all the property to which the company is or appears to be entitled.

\(2\) On the application of the liquidator, the Court may order that all or any part of the property belonging to the company or held by trustees on behalf of the company shall vest in the liquidator and the property shall, subject to _subsection \(3\)_, vest accordingly and the liquidator may, after giving such indemnity, if any, as the Court directs, bring or defend any action which relates to that property or of which is necessary to bring or defend for the purpose of effectually winding up the company and recovering its property.

\(3\) Where an order is made under _subsection \(2\)_, every liquidator in relation to whom the order is made shall within seven days of the making of the order—

     \(a\) lodge an office copy of the order with the Registrar; and

     \(b\) where the order relates to land, lodge an office copy of the order with the appropriate authority  
     concerned with the registration or recording of dealings in that land.

\(4\) No vesting order referred to in this section shall have any effect to transfer or otherwise vest any land until the appropriate entries are made with respect to the transferring or vesting by the appropriate authority.

\(5\) A liquidator who contravenes the requirement of _subsection \(3\)_ commits an offence and shall, on conviction, be liable to a fine not exceeding ten thousand ringgit and in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding five hundred ringgit for each day during which the offence continues after conviction.
