# Section 435. Liability as contributories of present and past members

\(1\) When a company is wound up, every present and past member shall be liable to contribute to the assets of the company to an amount sufficient for payment of its debts and liabilities and the costs, charges and expenses of the winding up and for the adjustment of the rights of the contributories among the present and past members.

\(2\) Subject to _subsection \(3\)_—

     \(a\) a past member shall not be liable to contribute under _subsection \(1\)_—

          \(i\) if he has ceased to be a member for one year or more before the commencement of the winding  
          up;

          \(ii\) in respect of any debt or liability of the company contracted after he ceased to be a member; or

          \(iii\) if it appears to the Court that the existing members are unable to satisfy the contributions  
          required to be made by the existing members under this Act;

     \(b\) in the case of a company limited by shares, no contribution shall be required from any member  
     exceeding the amount, if any, unpaid on the shares in respect of which the member is liable as a  
     present or past member;

     \(c\) in the case of a company limited by guarantee, no contribution shall, subject to _subsection \(5\)_, be  
     required from any member exceeding the amount undertaken to be contributed by him to the assets of  
     the company in the event of its being wound up;

     \(d\) nothing in this Act shall invalidate any provision contained in any policy of insurance or other  
     contract where—

          \(i\) the liability of the individual members on the policy or contract is restricted; or

          \(ii\) the funds of the company are alone made liable in respect of the policy or contract; or

     \(e\) a sum due to any member in his capacity as a member by way of dividends, profits or otherwise  
     shall not be a debt of the company payable to that member in a case of competition between himself  
     and any other creditor not a member, but any such sum may be taken into account for the purpose of  
     the final adjustment of the rights of the contributories among the members.

\(3\) In the winding up of a limited company, any director, whether past or present, whose liability is unlimited shall be liable to make a further contribution as if he were a member of an unlimited company in addition to his liability, if any, to contribute as an ordinary member.

\(4\) Notwithstanding anything in _subsection \(3\)_—

     \(a\) a past director shall not be liable to make a further contribution if he has ceased to hold office for a  
     year or more before the commencement of the winding up;

     \(b\) a past director shall not be liable to make a further contribution in respect of any debt or liability of  
     the company contracted after he ceased to hold office; and

     \(c\) subject to the constitution, a director shall not be liable to make a further contribution, unless the  
     Court deems it necessary to require that contribution in order to satisfy the debts and liabilities of the  
     company and the costs, charges and expenses of the winding up.

\(5\) On the winding up of a company limited both by shares and guarantee, every member shall be liable to contribute to the extent of any sums unpaid on any shares held by the member, in addition to the amount undertaken to be contributed by him to the assets of the company in the event of it being wound up.
