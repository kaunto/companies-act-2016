# Section 556. Power of Registrar to represent dissolved company in certain circumstances

\(1\) Where after a company has been dissolved, it is proved to the satisfaction of the Registrarâ€”

     \(a\)  that the company if still existing would be legally or equitably bound to carry out, complete or give   
     effect to some dealing, transaction or matter; and

     \(b\)  that in order to carry out, complete or give effect to the dealing, transaction or matter some purely   
     administrative act should have been done by or on behalf of the company if still existing,

the Registrar may in representing the company or its liquidator under this section do or cause to be done any such act.

\(2\) The Registrar may execute or sign any relevant instrument or document stating that he has done so under this section, and the execution or signature shall have the same force, validity and effect as if the company, if existing, had duly executed such instrument or document.
