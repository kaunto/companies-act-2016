     \(a\)  the liability, if any, of every director or officer and member of the company continues and may be   
     enforced as if the company had not been dissolved; and

     \(b\)  nothing in [section 550](section-550.-application-to-strike-off-company.md) shall affect the power of the Court to wind up a company, the name of which

     which can be realised. 

\(2\) Where the Court issued a winding up order under _paragraph \(1\)\(b\)_, the liquidator shall only be required to discover and realise any assets of the company.
