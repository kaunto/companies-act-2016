# Section 555. Power of Court to reinstate struck off company into register

 \(1\) Any person who is aggrieved by the decision of the Registrar to strike off the company may, within seven years after the name of the company has been struck off, apply to the Court to reinstate the name of the company into the register.

\(2\) If the Court is satisfied that the company was at the time of the striking off, carrying on business or in operation or otherwise that it is just that the name of the company be reinstated in the register, the Court may order thatâ€”

    \(a\)  the name of the company be reinstated; and

     \(b\)  give such directions and make such provisions as seem just for placing the company and all other                    
     persons in the same position as nearly as may be as if the name of the company had not been struck   
     off.

\(3\) Upon an office copy of the order is lodged with the Registrar, the company shall be deemed to have continued in existence as if its name had not been struck off.
