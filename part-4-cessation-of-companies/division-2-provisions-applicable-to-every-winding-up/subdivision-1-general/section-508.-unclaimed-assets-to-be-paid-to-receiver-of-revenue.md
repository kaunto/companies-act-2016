# Section 508. Unclaimed assets to be paid to receiver of revenue

\(1\) Where a liquidator has in his hands or under his control—

     \(a\)  any unclaimed dividend or other moneys which have remained unclaimed for more than six   
     months from the date when the dividend or other moneys became payable; or

     \(b\)  after making final distribution, any unclaimed or undistributed moneys arising from the estate of   
     the company,

the liquidator shall forthwith pay those moneys to the Official Receiver to be placed to the credit of the Companies Liquidation Account and whose receipt shall be an effectual discharge in respect of the unclaimed moneys.

\(2\) The Court may on application of the Official Receiver—

     \(a\)  order any liquidator to submit to it an account of any unclaimed or undistributed funds, dividends        
     or other moneys in his hands or under his control verified by affidavit and may direct an audit of the        
     account; and

     \(b\)  direct the liquidator to pay those moneys to the Official Receiver to be placed to the credit of the   
     Companies Liquidation Account.

\(3\) The interest or return arising from the investment of the moneys standing to the credit of the Companies Liquidation Account shall be paid into the Consolidated Fund.

\(4\) For the purposes of this section, the Court may exercise all the powers conferred by this Act with respect to the discovery and realization of the property of the company and the provisions of this Act with respect to the discovery and realization shall, with such adaptations as are prescribed, apply to the proceedings under this section.

\(5\) Unless expressly provided for in this Act, this section shall not deprive any person of any other right or remedy to which he is entitled against the liquidator or any other person.

\(6\) If any claimant makes any demand for any money placed to the credit of the Companies Liquidation Account, the Official Receiver upon being satisfied that the claimant is the owner of the money—

     \(a\)  shall authorize payment to be made to him out of the Account; or

     \(b\)  if it has been paid into the Consolidated Fund, may authorize payment of the same amount to be   
     made to him out of moneys made available by Parliament for the purpose.

\(7\) Any person dissatisfied with the decision of the Official Receiver in respect of a claim made under _subsection \(6\)_ may appeal to the Court which may confirm, disallow or vary the decision.

\(8\) Where any unclaimed moneys paid to any claimant are afterwards claimed by any other person, that other person shall not be entitled to any payment out of the Consolidated Fund under _subsection \(6\)_, but may have recourse against the claimant to whom the unclaimed moneys have been paid.

\(9\) Any unclaimed moneys paid to the credit of the Companies Liquidation Account to the extent to which the said moneys have not been paid out of the Account under this section shall, on the lapse of six years from the date of the payment of the moneys to the credit of the Account, be paid into the Consolidated Fund.
