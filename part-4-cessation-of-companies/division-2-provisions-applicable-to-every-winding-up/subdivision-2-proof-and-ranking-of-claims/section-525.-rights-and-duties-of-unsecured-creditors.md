\(3\) The affidavit shall—

     \(a\)  verify the debt;

     \(b\)  be made by the creditor himself or by any person authorized by or on behalf of the creditor or his   
     estate and if made by a person so authorized, it shall state his authority and means of knowledge;

     \(c\)  contain or refer to a statement of account showing the particulars of the debt and shall specify   
     the vouchers, if any, by which the statement of account can be substantiated; and

     \(d\)  state whether the creditor is or is not a secured creditor.

\(4\) The liquidator may at any time call for the production of the vouchers or books of account.
