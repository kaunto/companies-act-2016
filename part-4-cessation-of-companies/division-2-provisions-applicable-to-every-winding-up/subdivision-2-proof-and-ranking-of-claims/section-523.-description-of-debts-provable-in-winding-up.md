# Section 523. Description of debts provable in winding up

\(1\) Demands in the nature of unliquidated damages arising otherwise than by reason of a contract, promise or breach of trust shall not be provable in winding up.

\(2\) A person having notice of any winding up order in a winding up by the Court or a resolution has been passed in a voluntary winding up shall not prove under the winding up for any debt or liability contracted by the company subsequent to the date of his so having notice.

\(3\) Save as provided in _subsections \(1\)_ and _\(2\)_, all debts and liabilities present or future, certain or contingent, to which the company is subject at the date of the winding up order or the resolution, or to which the company may become subject before dissolution by reason of any obligation incurred before the date of the winding up order shall be deemed to be debts provable in winding up.

\(4\) An estimation shall be made by the liquidator of the value of any debt or liability provable under _subsection \(3\)_ which, by reason of its being subject to any contingency or for any other reason, does not bear a certain value.

\(5\) Any person aggrieved by the estimate made under _subsection\(4\)_ may appeal to the Court.

\(6\) If in the opinion of the Court, the value of the debt or the liability is incapable of being fairly estimated, the Court may make an order to that effect, and the debt or liability shall for the purposes of this Act be deemed to be a debt not provable in winding up.

\(7\) If in the opinion of the Court the value of the debt or liability is capable of being fairly estimated, the Court may assess the same and may give all necessary directions for this purpose, and the amount of the value when assessed shall be deemed to be a debt provable in winding up.
