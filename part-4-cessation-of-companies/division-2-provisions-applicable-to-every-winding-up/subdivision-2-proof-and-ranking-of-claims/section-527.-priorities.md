     \(d\)  fourthly, all remuneration payable to any employee in respect of vacation leave, or in the case of

     commencement of the winding up by the company as the employer of any person under any written        
     law relating to employees social security contribution and superannuation or provident funds or        
     under any scheme of superannuation or retirement benefit which is an approved scheme under the        
     federal law relating to income tax; and

     \(f\)  sixthly, the amount of all federal tax assessed under any written law before the date of the                                                  
     commencement of the winding up or assessed at any time before the time fixed for the proving of   
     debts has expired.

\(2\) The debts in each class specified in _subsection \(1\)_ shall rank in the order specified but debts of the same class shall rank pari passu and shall be paid in full, unless the property of the company is insufficient to meet the debts, in which case the payment shall be reduced and the rate of reduction shall be in equal proportion.

\(3\) Where any payment has been made to any employee of the company on account of wages, salary or vacation leave out of money advanced by a person for that purpose, the person by whom the money was advanced shall, in a winding up, have a right of priority in respect of the money so advanced and paid, up to the amount by which the sum in respect of which the employee would have been entitled to priority in the winding up has been diminished by reason of the payment, and shall have the same right of priority in respect of that amount as the employee would have had if the payment had not been made.

\(4\) So far as the assets of the company available for payment of general creditors are insufficient to meet any preferential debts specified in _subparagraphs \(1\)\(b\), \(d\)_ and _\(e\)_ and any amount payable in priority by virtue of _subsection \(3\)_, those debts shall have priority over the claims of the holders of debentures under any floating charge created by the company, and shall be paid accordingly out of any property comprised in or subject to that charge.

\(5\) Where the company is under a contract of insurance, entered into before the commencement of the winding up, insured against liability to third parties, then if any such liability is incurred by the company, either before or after the commencement of the winding up, and an amount in respect of that liability is or has been received by the company or the liquidator from the insurer, the amount shall, after deducting any expenses of or incidental to getting in the amount, be paid by the liquidator to the third party in respect of whom the liability was incurred to the extent necessary to discharge that liability or any part of that liability remaining undischarged in priority to all payments in respect of the debts referred to in _subsection \(1\)_.

\(6\) If the liability of the insurer to the company is less than the liability of the company to the third party, nothing in _subsection \(5\)_ shall limit the rights of the third party in respect of the balance.

\(7\) _Subsections\(5\)_ and _\(6\)_ shall have effect notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary entered into after the commencement of this Act.

\(8\) Notwithstanding _subsection \(1\)_—

     \(a\) _paragraph \(c\)_ of that subsection shall not apply in relation to the winding up of a company in any                                                  
     case where the company is being wound up voluntarily merely for the purpose of reconstruction or                 
     of amalgamation with another company and the right to the compensation has on the reconstruction                                                       
     or amalgamation been preserved to the person entitled thereto, or where the company has entered                                                  
     into a contract with an insurer in respect of any liability under any law relating to workers             
     compensation; and

     \(b\) where a company has given security for the payment or repayment of any amount to which        
     _paragraph\(1\)\(f\)_ relates, that paragraph shall apply only in relation to the balance of any such amount   
     remaining due after deducting from the balance the net amount realized from such security.

\(9\) Where in any winding up assets have been recovered under an indemnity for costs of litigation given by certain creditors, or have been protected or preserved by the payment of moneys or the giving of indemnity by creditors, or where expenses in relation to which a creditor has indemnified a liquidator, have been recovered, the Court may make such order as it deems just with respect to the distribution of those assets and the amount of those expenses so recovered with a view to giving those creditors an advantage over others in consideration of the risk run by the creditors in so doing.

\(10\) Subject to this Act, all debts proved in a winding up shall be paid _pari passu._
