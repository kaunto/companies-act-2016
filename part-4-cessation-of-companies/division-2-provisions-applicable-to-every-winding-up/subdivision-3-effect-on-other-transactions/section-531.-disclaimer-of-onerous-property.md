# Section 531. Disclaimer of onerous property

\(1\) Where any part of the property of a company consists of—

    \(a\)  any estate or interest in land which is burdened with onerous covenants;

     \(b\)  shares in corporations;

     \(c\)  unprofitable contracts; or

     \(d\)  any other property that is unsaleable, or not readily saleable, by reason of its binding the                                                       
     possessor of the property to the performance of any onerous act, or to the payment of any sum of                                                  
     money,

the liquidator of the company, notwithstanding that he has endeavoured to sell or has taken possession of the property or exercised any act of ownership in relation to the property, may, with the leave of the Court or committee of inspection and subject to this section, in writing signed by him, at any time within twelve months after the commencement of the winding up or such extended period as is allowed by the Court, disclaim the property.

\(2\) Where any such property under _subsection \(1\)_ has not come to the knowledge of the liquidator within thirty days from the commencement of the winding up, the power of disclaiming may be exercised at any time within twelve months after he has become aware of the property or such extended period as is allowed by the Court.

\(3\) The disclaimer shall operate to determine, as from the date of disclaimer, the rights, interest and liabilities of the company and the property of the company in or in respect of the property disclaimed, but shall not, except so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing the company and the property of the company from liability, affect the rights or liabilities of any other person.

\(4\) The Court or committee of inspection before or on granting leave to disclaim may require such notices to be given to persons interested, and impose such terms as a condition of granting leave, and make such other order on the matter as the Court or committee of inspection thinks just.

\(5\) The liquidator shall not be entitled to disclaim if an application in writing has been made to the liquidator by any person interested in the property requiring him to decide whether he will or will not disclaim, and the liquidator has not, within a period of twenty-eight days from the receipt of the application or such further period as is allowed by the Court or committee of inspection, given notice to the applicant that he intends to apply to the Court or committee of inspection for leave to disclaim, and, in the case of a contract, if the liquidator after such an application in writing does not within that period or further period disclaim the contract, the liquidator shall be deemed to have adopted it.

\(6\) The Court may, on the application of a person who is, as against the liquidator, entitled to the benefit or subject to the burden of a contract made with the company, make an order rescinding the contract on such terms as to the payment by or to either party of damages for the non-performance of the contract, or otherwise as the Court thinks just, and any damages payable under the order to that person may be proved by him as a debt in the winding up.

\(7\) The Court may, on the application of a person who either—

     \(a\)  claims any interest in any disclaimed property; or

     \(b\)  is under any liability not discharged by this Act in respect of any disclaimed property,

and on hearing such persons as it thinks fit, make an order for the vesting of the property in or the delivery of the property to any person entitled to the property, or to whom it seems just that the property should be delivered by way of compensation for such liability, or a trustee for him, and on such terms as the Court thinks just.

\(8\) On the lodgement of an office copy of the vesting order with the Registrar and with the Official Receiver and if the order relates to land, with the appropriate authority concerned with the recording or registration of dealings in that land, as the case requires, the property comprised in the order shall vest accordingly in the person named in the order in that behalf without any further conveyance, transfer or assignment.

\(9\) Notwithstanding anything in _subsections \(7\)_ and _\(8\)_, where the property disclaimed is of a leasehold nature, the Court shall not make a vesting order in favour of any person claiming under the company, whether as under-lessee or as mortgagee, except upon the terms of making that person—

     \(a\)  subject to the same liabilities and obligations as those to which the company was subject under   
     the lease in respect of the property at the commencement of the winding up; or

     \(b\)  if the Court thinks fit, subject only to the same liabilities and obligations as if the lease had been   
     assigned to that person at that date,

and in either event, if the case so requires, as if the lease had comprised only the property comprised in the vesting order, and any mortgagee or under-lessee declining to accept a vesting order upon those terms shall be excluded from all the interest in and the security upon the property, and, if there is no person claiming under the company who is willing to accept an order upon those terms, the Court may vest the estate and interest of the company in the property in any person liable personally or in a representative character and either alone or jointly with the company to perform the lessee’s covenants in the lease, freed and discharged from all the estates, encumbrances and interest created in the vesting order by the company.

\(10\) Any person aggrieved by the operation of a disclaimer under this section shall be deemed to be a creditor of the company to the amount of the grievances, and may accordingly prove the amount as a debt in the winding up.
