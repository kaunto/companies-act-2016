# Section 534. Duties of bailiff as to goods taken in execution

\(1\) Subject to _subsection \(3\)_, where any goods of a company are taken in execution and, before the sale of the goods or the completion of the execution by the receipt or recovery of the full amount of the levy, notice is served on the bailiff that a liquidator has been appointed or that a winding up order has been made or that a resolution for voluntary winding up has been passed, the bailiff shall, on being so required, deliver the goods and any money seized or received in part satisfaction of the execution to the liquidator, but the costs of the execution shall be a first charge on the goods or moneys so delivered, and the liquidator may sell the goods, or a sufficient part of the goods, for the purpose of satisfying that charge.

\(2\) Subject to _subsection \(4\)_, where under an execution in respect of a judgment for a sum exceeding one hundred ringgit, the goods of a company are sold or money is paid in order to avoid sale, the bailiff shall deduct the costs of the execution from the proceeds of the sale or the money paid and retain the balance for fourteen days.

\(3\) If within the period of execution notice is served on the bailiff of a petition for the winding up of the company having been presented or of a meeting having been called at which there is to be proposed a resolution for the voluntary winding up and an order is made or a resolution is passed for the winding up, the bailiff shall pay the balance to the liquidator who shall be entitled to retain it as against the execution creditor.

\(4\) The rights conferred by this section on the liquidator may be set aside by the Court in favour of the creditor to such extent and subject to such terms as the Court thinks fit.
