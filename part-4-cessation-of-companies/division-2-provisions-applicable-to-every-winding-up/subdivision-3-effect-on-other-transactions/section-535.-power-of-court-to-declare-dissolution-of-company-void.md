# Section 535. Power of Court to declare dissolution of company void

\(1\) Where a company has been dissolved, the Court may, at any time within two years after the date of dissolution, on an application of the liquidator of the company or of any other person who appears to the Court to be interested, make an order upon such terms as the Court thinks fit declaring the dissolution to have been void, and such proceedings may be taken as might have been taken if the company had not been dissolved.

\(2\) The person on whose application the order was made, shall, within seven days from the making of the order or such further time as the Court allows, lodge with the Registrar and with the Official Receiver an office copy of the order and the person who fails so to do commits an offence and shall, on conviction, be liable to a fine not exceeding ten thousand ringgit.
