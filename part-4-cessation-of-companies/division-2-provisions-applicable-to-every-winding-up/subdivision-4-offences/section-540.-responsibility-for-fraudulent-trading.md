# Section 540. Responsibility for fraudulent trading

\(1\) If in the course of the winding up of a company or in any proceedings against a company it appears that any business of the company has been carried on with intent to defraud the creditors of the company or creditors of any other person or for any fraudulent purpose, the Court on the application of the liquidator or any creditor or contributory of the company, may, if the Court thinks proper so to do, declare that any person who was knowingly a party to the carrying on of the business in that manner shall be personally responsible, without any limitation of liability, for all or any of the debts or other liabilities of the company as the Court directs.

\(2\) Where a person has been convicted of an offence under [subsection 539\(3\)](section-539.-liability-where-proper-accounts-not-kept.md) in relation to the contracting of such a debt as is referred to in that section, the Court on the application of the liquidator or any creditor or contributory of the company may, if the Court thinks proper so to do, declare that the person shall be personally responsible without any limitation of liability for the payment of the whole or any part of that debt.

\(3\) When the Court makes any declaration under _subsection \(1\)_ or _\(2\)_, the Court may give such further directions as it thinks proper for the purpose of giving effect to that declaration, and in particular may make provision for making the liability of any person under the declaration a charge on any debt or obligation due from the company to the person, or on any charge or any interest in any charge on any assets of the company held by or vested in the person or any corporation or person on his behalf, or any person claiming as assignee from or through the person liable or any corporation or person acting on his behalf, and may from time to time make such further order as is necessary for the purpose of enforcing any charge imposed under this subsection.

\(4\) For the purposes of _subsection \(3\)_, “assignee” includes any person to whom or in whose favour by the directions of the person liable the debt, obligation or charge was created, issued or transferred or the interest created, but does not include an assignee for valuable consideration and consideration by way of marriage, given in good faith and without notice of any of the matters on the ground of which the declaration is made.

\(5\) Where any business of a company is carried on with the intent or for the purpose mentioned in _subsection \(1\)_, every person who was knowingly a party to the carrying on of the business with that intent or purpose, commits an offence and shall, on conviction, be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or to a fine not exceeding one million ringgit or to both.

\(6\) This section shall have effect notwithstanding that the person concerned is criminally liable under this Act in respect of the matters on the ground of which the declaration is made.

\(7\) On the hearing of an application under _subsection \(1\)_ or _\(2\)_, the liquidator may give evidence or call witnesses himself.
