\(1\) If in the course of winding up it appears thatâ€”

      \(a\) any person who has taken part in the formation or promotion of the company; or

      \(b\) any past or present liquidator or officer,

has misapplied or retained or become liable or accountable for any money or property of the company or been guilty of any misfeasance or breach of trust or duty in relation to the company, the Court may, on the application of the liquidator or of any creditor or contributory examine into the conduct of that person, liquidator or officer and compel him to repay or restore the money or property or any part of the money with interest at such rate as the Court thinks just, or to contribute such sum to the assets of the company by way of compensation in respect of the misapplication, retainer, misfeasance or breach of trust or duty as the Court thinks just.

\(2\) This section shall extend and apply to and in respect of the receipt of any money or property by any officer of the company during the two years preceding the commencement of the winding up whether by way of salary or otherwise which appears to the Court to be unfair or unjust to other members of the company.

\(3\) This section shall have effect notwithstanding that the offence is one for which the offender is criminally liable.
