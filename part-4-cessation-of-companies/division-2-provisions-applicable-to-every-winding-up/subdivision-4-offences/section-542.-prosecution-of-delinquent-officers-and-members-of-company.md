# Section 542. Prosecution of delinquent officers and members of company

\(1\) If it appears to the Court in the course of a winding up by the Court that any past or present officer or any member of the company has been guilty of an offence in relation to the company for which he is criminally liable, the Court may, either on the application of any person interested in the winding up or of its own motion, direct the liquidator either to prosecute the offender himself or to refer the matter to the Minister.

\(2\) If it appears to the liquidator in the course of a voluntary winding up that any past or present officer or any member of the company has been guilty of any offence in relation to the company for which he is criminally liable, he shall forthwith report the matter to the Minister and shall, in respect of information or documents in his possession or under his control which relate to the matter in question, furnish the Minister with such information and give to him such access to and facilities for inspecting and taking copies of any documents as he may require.

\(3\) If it appears to the liquidator in the course of any winding up that the company which is being wound up will be unable to pay its unsecured creditors more than fifty cents in the ringgit, the liquidator shall forthwith report the matter in writing to the Official Receiver and shall furnish the Official Receiver with such information and give to him such access to and facilities for inspecting and taking copies of any documents as the Official Receiver may require.

\(4\) Where any report is made under _subsection \(2\)_ or _\(3\)_, the Minister may, if he thinks fit, investigate the matter and may apply to the Court for an order conferring on him or any person designated by him for the purpose with respect to the company concerned all such powers of investigating the affairs of the company as are provided by this Act in the case of a winding up by the Court, but if it appears to him that the case is not one in which proceedings ought to be taken by him, he shall inform the liquidator accordingly, and subject to the previous approval of the Court, the liquidator may himself take proceedings against the offender.

\(5\) If it appears to the Court in the course of a voluntary winding up that any past or present officer or any member of the company has been guilty as mentioned in _subsection \(2\)_ and that no report with respect to the matter has been made by the liquidator to the Minister, the Court may, on the application of any person interested in the winding up or of its own motion, direct the liquidator to make such a report, and on a report being made accordingly, this section shall have effect as though the report has been made under _subsection \(2\)_.

\(6\) Where any matter is reported or referred to the Minister or Official Receiver under this section, he considers that the case is one in which a prosecution ought to be instituted, he may institute proceedings accordingly, and the liquidator and every officer and agent of the company past and present, other than the defendant in the proceedings, shall give the Minister or Official Receiver all assistance in connection with the prosecution which he is reasonably able to give.

\(7\) For the purposes of _subsection \(6\)_, “agent”, in relation to a company, includes any banker or advocate of the company and any person employed by the company as auditor, whether or not an officer of the company.

\(8\) If any person fails or neglects to give assistance in the manner required by _subsection \(6\)_, the Court may, on the application of the Minister or Official Receiver, direct that person to comply with the requirements of that subsection, and where any application is made under this subsection with respect to a liquidator, the Court may, unless it appears that the failure or neglect to comply was due to the liquidator not having in his hands sufficient assets of the company to enable him so to do, direct that the costs of the application shall be borne by the liquidator personally.

\(9\) The Minister may direct that the whole or any part of any costs and expenses properly incurred by the liquidator in proceedings brought under this section shall be defrayed out of the moneys provided by Parliament.

\(10\) Subject to any direction given under subsection \(9\) and to any charges on the assets of the company and any debts to which priority is given by this Act, all such costs and expenses shall be payable out of those assets as part of the costs of winding up.
