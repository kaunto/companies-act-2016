# Section 50. Register of members

1. Every company shall keep a register of its members and record in the register—

  * the names, addresses, number of the identity card issued under the National Registration Act 1959 \[Act 78\], if any, nationality and the usual place of residence of every person who is to be a member and, where any of the member is a corporation, the corporate name, place of incorporation, establishment or origin, registration number and registered office of the corporation and any other relevant information and particulars of the members;

  * in the case of a company having a share capital, a statement of the shares held by each member, distinguishing each share by an appropriate number, or by the number of the certificate, if any, and of the amount paid or agreed to be considered as paid on the shares of each member;

  * the date at which the name of each person was entered in the register as a member;

  * the date at which any person who ceased to be a member during the previous seven years so ceased to be a member; and

  * in the case of a company having a share capital, the date of every allotment of shares to members and the number of shares comprised in each allotment.

2. Notwithstanding _subsection \(1\)_—

  * where the company has converted any of its shares into stock and given notice of the conversion to the Registrar, the company shall alter the register to show the amount of stock or number of stock units held by each member instead of the number of shares and the particulars relating to shares specified in _paragraph \(1\)\(b\)_;

  * a company may keep the names and particulars relating to persons who have ceased to be members of the company separately and the names and particulars relating to former members need not be supplied to any person who applies for a copy of the register unless he specifically requests the names and particulars of former members.

3. The register of members shall be prima facie evidence of any matters inserted in the register as required or authorized by this Act.

4. The company and every officer who contravene this section commit an offence and shall, on conviction, be liable to a fine not exceeding ten thousand ringgit and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding five hundred ringgit for each day during which the offence continues after conviction.
