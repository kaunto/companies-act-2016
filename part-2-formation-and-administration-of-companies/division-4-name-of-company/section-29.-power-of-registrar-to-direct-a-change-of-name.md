\(2\) If a company fails to change its name within the period as stated in the notice issued under _subsection \(1\)_, the Registrar shall have the power to change the company’s name to its company registration number or any such expression as assigned under [_subsection 25\(2\)_](section-25.-name-of-company.md) by altering the company’s registration details to reflect the change.

\(3\) The company and every officer who contravene the direction of the Registrar under this section commit an offence.
