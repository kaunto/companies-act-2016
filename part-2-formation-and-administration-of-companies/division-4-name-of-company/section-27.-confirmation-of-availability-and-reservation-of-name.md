\(1\) A person shall apply to the Registrar to confirm the availability of a proposed name.

\(2\) If the Registrar is satisfied that the proposed name is a name which is not subject to [_subsection 26\(1\)_](section-26.-availability-of-name.md), the Registrar shall confirm the availability of the proposed name.

\(4\) A person may apply to the Registrar for the reservation of a name asâ€”

     \(a\) the name of the proposed company prior to its incorporation; or

     \(b\) the name to which a company proposes to change its name under [section 28.](section-28.-change-of-name.md)

\(5\) Upon being satisfied that the name is not one which may be refused on any ground referred to in [_subsection 26\(1\)_](section-26.-availability-of-name.md) and upon payment of the prescribed fee, the Registrar may reserve the name for a period of thirty days from the date of lodgement of the application or such longer period as the Registrar may allow.

\(7\) ****Subject to this Act, the Registrar shall not be liable for any loss or damage suffered by any person by reason of error or omission of whatever nature or however arising, if such error or omission was made in good faith and in the discharge of duties under this section.
