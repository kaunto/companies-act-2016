  * it is an offer to subscribe for securities to be held under an employees’ share scheme and, where the offer is made on terms allowing that person to renounce his rights, the rights may only be renounced in favour of—

    * another person entitled to hold securities under the scheme; or

    * a person already connected with the company.
